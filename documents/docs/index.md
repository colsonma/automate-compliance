# Welcome to WPS317-R - Security in the cloud means more than you think
For public sector customers, ensuring compliance and security is vital. AWS provides these organizations with a broad set of cloud-based services to build world-class solutions. In this session, we go over native logging tools in AWS, such as AWS CloudTrail, Amazon CloudWatch Alarms, Amazon CloudWatch Logs, and Amazon GuardDuty. We also cover automated remediation of compliance events, alerting tools, and other methods of implementing compliance.

# Summary of Session
In this workshop, we're going to explore using CloudWatch Events, CloudTrail, and GuardDuty to help assure compliance in a given account.  Each area will demonstrate one or more services, that tie back to specific compliance controls. The examples provided are to show how we can map those high level requirements to features native to AWS.
